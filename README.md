Codebot
=======

Codebot is a free and open source (MIT license) IDE focused on game development. Below is a screenshot of the current development state (something like alpha):

Idea and Goals
=======

Codebot is a code editing program equipped with built-in tools to help you make your game faster (read full thoughts [here](http://www.as3gamegears.com/blog/codebot-an-ide-focused-on-gamedev/)). Developing a game is much more than just coding, you have to tweak art, build levels, convert files, find assets/extensions, read docs about building and publishing, and so on.

The IDE should help us do that, or do it all by itself. Imagine you are working on your [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/)/[1GAM](http://onegameamonth.com) game and you need an 8-bit SFX. You click a button, a panel slides, you type in a few keywords, select what you want and done!

Features
=======
* Full-featured code editor
* Support for Javascript projects (Haxe coming soon!)
* Files panel (drag/rename/move files around)
* Built-in 8-bit SFXs panel
* Built-in assets finder panel (currently works with a curated list of opengameart.org)
* View different file types (images, sounds, text)
* Projects manager
* Support for plugins
* Works in the cloud

Supported platforms
=======

* Web (running as a website) (***working***)
* MacOS (*under development*)
* Linux (*under development*)
* Windows (*under development*)

Under the hood Codebot is built with JS/HTML/CSS. When used as a native app, Codebot uses [Node Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).

License
=======

Codebot is licensed under the MIT license.

Contribute
=======

The development process is a little bit rough right now. It's basically me coding and changing things a lot, without documenting anything along the way. At some point, the APIs will stabilize and it will be a lot easier to join the party.

If you want to help now, you can take Codebot for a ride and send me your feedback, or suggest a feature, or send a "cool!"/"insane!" motivational message :). Just ping me at [@as3gamegears](http://twitter.com/as3gamegears).
